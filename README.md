# JavaScript 30 Challenge
Wes Bos put together an entertaining collection of 30 videos focusing on vanilla JavaScript.  Let's take this opportunity to push ourselves to learn something new or just refresh on some foundational concepts we may not have used in awhile.  The goal is to complete all 30 videos between October 10th and November 17th.

## Guidlines
- Create a seperate branch for your own commits.
- No judgement on each other's code. We're all here to learn and become better developers.
- Participate in weekly check-ins to discuss what you learned and share any extra freatures you added. (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays right after standup)
- When Wes pauses during the video and suggests you try the solution on your own, go ahead and give it your best shot!
